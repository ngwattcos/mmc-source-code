				<div class="text-normal">The Monmouth Math Circle is a program that seeks to train students of Monmouth County and beyond for mathematics competitions, and potentially help with other mathematical endeavors such as research and advancing course placement. As such, however, it is primarily focused on students who are seeking a greater challenge than what they encounter in the classroom and not focused on tutoring for courses or SATs. It seeks to promote problem solving and conceptual understanding over rote memorization and finds that contests are an engaging and stimulating environment for this kind of math. It also seeks to provide an environment where individual students can learn at their own pace while at the same time having a peer group with which to share their love of math. It views contest math as having the potential to be like a team sport â€“ an avenue for not just friendly competition, but for cooperation. The Monmouth Math Circle does not administer competitions. It assumes students will participate through their school or other avenues. The Monmouth Math Circle also gives leadership positions to students who demonstrate strong skill in both mathematics and leadership/pedagogy. This is a great opportunity to gain experience mixing technical expertise with effective interpersonal leadership skills and demonstrate such skills.</div>
